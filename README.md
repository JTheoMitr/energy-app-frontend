'Energy Pioneers' Rails as an API Portfolio Project
---------------

This application acts as the front end portion of my Rails as an API Portfolio Project.


Usage
-----
To begin, you will first need to open up the backend repository here: https://github.com/JTheoMitr/energy-app-backend

To seed some preliminary information into the database, enter the following into your terminal:

rails db:seed

Run the rails server by entering the following in your terminal:

rails s

once the server is running, come back to this repo, and enter the following in your terminal:

open index.html

From there you will use the page that opens in your default browser.

Once finished - remember to exit the rails server in your terminal (ctrl + c) before closing out your development environment!
